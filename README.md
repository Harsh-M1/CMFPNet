# CMFPNet
This is a Cross-Modal Multi-Dimensional Frequency Domain Perception Network designed for extracting information from multi-modal remote sensing images of nearshore aquaculture areas (raft aquaculture and cage aquaculture). CMFPNet includes a Local-global Perception Block (LGPB) that integrates local and global semantic information to enhance the model's robustness across different marine environments. We also designed a Multi-dimensional Adaptive Frequency Filtering Attention Block (MAFFAB) to dynamically filter frequency domain information beneficial for aquaculture area recognition, thereby improving recognition accuracy.

This part is currently under submission for publication. The data and related code for the model will be made publicly available after the review is complete.
